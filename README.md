### What is a Data Structure?
> Data structure is a way in which data are stored for efficient search and retrieval.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Different data structures are suited for different problems. Some data structures are useful for simple general problems, such as retrieving data that has been stored with a specific identifier. For example, an online dictionary can be structured so that it can retrieve the definition of a word. On the other hand, specialized data structures have been devised to solve complex specific search problems.
