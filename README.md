## What is a Data Structure?
> Data structure is a way in which data are stored for efficient search and retrieval.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Different data structures are suited for different problems. Some data structures are useful for simple general problems, such as retrieving data that has been stored with a specific identifier. For example, an online dictionary can be structured so that it can retrieve the definition of a word. On the other hand, specialized data structures have been devised to solve complex specific search problems.

  Array - the simplest data sctructure. The problem that I'm having is that when including an image in README.md as ![basic CRUD](BasicCrud.png), with the image file in the same directory, the displayed README file is expanding the image to the width of the screen. I don't want it to scale the image at all! Really, why would it do that by default? I also would prefer to not use HTML (though if that's the only solution, I'll do that). Furthermore, I'll eventually include a lot of images - it would be a pain to have to look up the size of each and use an explicit size in README.md
